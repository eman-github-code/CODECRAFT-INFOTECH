# 🔐 Task 03: Automated Login Test Suite

## 📌 Project Overview
As an SQA Intern at **CodeCraft Infotech**, I synthesized a robust automated test suite to validate the authentication module of a web application. This project ensures the **functional integrity** of the login process by simulating real-world user interactions.

## 🎯 Test Objectives
The primary goal was to conduct a **rigorous validation** of the login portal using the following scenarios:
* **Positive Validation:** Successful authentication using verified credentials.
* **Negative Validation (Invalid):** Ensuring the system correctly rejects unauthorized access.
* **Negative Validation (Null):** Verifying that empty input fields trigger the appropriate safety constraints.

## 🛠️ Technical Scaffolding
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Framework:** Selenium WebDriver
* **Design Pattern:** Modular Scripting
* **Assertions:** URL verification and "Flash" message validation.



## 🚀 Execution
To witness the **vitality** of the script:
1. Ensure the Chrome WebDriver is configured in your system PATH.
2. Execute the script via terminal: `python task_03_login.py`
