# 🌍 Task 04: Cross-Browser Testing via BrowserStack

## 📌 Project Overview
In this **formidable** task, I evolved the testing strategy from local execution to **cloud-based cross-browser validation**. Utilizing **BrowserStack's Selenium Grid**, I ensured that the application maintains **unwavering functionality** across diverse operating systems and rendering engines.

## 🎯 Scope of Evaluation
To maintain **technical integrity**, the test suite was executed across the following environments:
* **Google Chrome:** Windows 11 (Blink Engine)
* **Mozilla Firefox:** macOS Monterey (Gecko Engine)
* **Apple Safari:** macOS Big Sur (WebKit Engine)



## 📊 Key Findings & Erudition
During the execution, I performed a **granular analysis** of the UI/UX. The documentation focuses on:
* **Visual Inconsistencies:** Monitoring CSS rendering differences across engines.
* **Performance Latency:** Measuring response times in remote cloud environments.
* **Functional Steadfastness:** Ensuring the backend logic remains consistent regardless of the user's browser.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure
* **Integration:** BrowserStack Automate API
* **Language:** Python 
* **Remote WebDriver:** Configured for high-concurrency execution.
